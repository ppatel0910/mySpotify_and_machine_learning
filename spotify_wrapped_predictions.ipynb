    "## In 2022, my overall Spotify account usage decreased from the top 1% to the top 10% most active Spotify users. This puzzled me personally, I was in the 99th percentile for a consistent five years. And from my point of view, this was wildly inaccurate. This was the year that I worked my first full-time office job. It's probably easy to believe for the average, entry-level, white collar worker that my job needed little to intelligence to excel, and even less to work there for 20+ years. Even though I accrued most of my time on Spotify through my job,  I deserve(d) to maintain my self-proclaimed coveted title as one of Spotify's biggest users. But unfortunately, for some reason that I may never know I did not renew that title this year.  "
