## Background

### Spotify is a leading digital platform for streaming music, podcasts, and playlists, offering users a vast selection of audio content. Accessible through its app or website, Spotify allows listeners to enjoy on-demand music, curate personalized playlists, and explore new artists and genres. With both free and premium subscription tiers, Spotify has become a go-to destination for music lovers globally. (and personally myself)

### As a daily user of Spotify, I can attest that the song/tracks recommended are not up to par. So naturally, I sought out a way to recommend myself better songs. Within this notebook, I will use the Spotify Web API to extract songs and features from my own playlists to produce new song recommendations for myself.

### To use the Spotify API, users should start with the Spotify API documentation, link is below
